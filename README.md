## How to Play

1. Start the Game:

Once the game is loaded, the grid will appear with empty squares.
Player X always starts first. The current player's turn is displayed above the board.

2. Make a Move:

Players take turns clicking on an empty square on the grid to place their marker (X or O).
The game automatically alternates turns between Player X and Player O.

3. Winning the Game:

The first player to place three of their markers in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
Once a player wins, a message is displayed announcing the winner (e.g., "Player X Wins!").

4. Tie Game:

If all the squares are filled and no player has three in a row, the game ends in a tie. A message is displayed stating "It's a tie!"
